## Post-Demo Q&A

### Common Questions

- **"How does it work offline?"** - All data stored in localStorage
- **"Can I add my own foods?"** - Yes, custom entries are supported
- **"Is the AI accurate?"** - It's a demo with fallbacks, production would need better training
- **"How do you calculate health scores?"** - Based on nutrition density and balance
- **"Can I export my data?"** - Not in this demo, but would be easy to add

### Technical Questions

- **"What's the tech stack?"** - React + Vite + localStorage + optional AI proxy
- **"How do you handle state?"** - React hooks + localStorage persistence
- **"Is it scalable?"** - For demo purposes, production would need a backend
- **"How do you ensure data privacy?"** - All data stays in user's browser

**Remember**: This is a demo app designed to showcase concepts. In production, you'd want proper backend, user authentication, data export, and more robust AI integration.
